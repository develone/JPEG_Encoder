# JPEG_Encoder

JPEG Encoder RTL design was written from scratch, but referenced a JPEG encoder written in C++ from Jon Olick, which is public domain.  Thanks Jon for the great, simple encoder examples!

The RTL and register settings for the OV7670 was partially written and assisted by Thanh Tien Truong from Portland State University. Thank you for your help Thanh Tien Truong!

RTL for sc_fifo.v and sc_fifo_32.v is from OpenCores.org and provided under LPGL license.  Thanks Open Cores!
